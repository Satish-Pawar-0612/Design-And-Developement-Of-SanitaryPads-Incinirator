Design-And-Developement-Of-SanitaryPads-Incinirator
A research based project for the design of incinerator (product model, internal electronics and power systems).

The proposed system is to present the invention, thereby contemplates an essentially simple portable construction, adapted to be hung on any wall in a lavatory in order to dispose of sanitary napkins conveniently, efficiently, and economically. The Present research work deals with an effective solution to dump and dispose the menstrual waste with the help of an incinerator. The Sanitary Napkin Incinerator disposes napkins in an environment friendly method by burning the pads and converting it into ash.

Here the heat Produced is used to burn the sanitary napkin which is Dumped into the incinerator. For this purpose, the most used heating coil made up of Ni-Chrome Alloy is used. When the Sanitary napkin burns, it is reduced to ashes. The burnt Ashes will be collected at the removable ash collector.

There are solutions already for the incineration of pads but they are heavy, big and high power consuming. Our solution is a step to make this change and create a product which is portable and very cost effective and minimilistic complexity. 

The incinirator can be battery operated (12V) and max current of 10A. A solution with just 120W max comsumption. The elctronics does use an SMPS to be used over AC power Supplys and can be worked with a small rechargable battery of just 20Ah max. The major functionalities of the incinirator are:
  - Auto detection of pad, when inserted into the burning chamber: This makes the product to be contactless and hence eliminates any hyigene reated worries.
  - Automatic initiation of the burning coil: The IR sensor detect the pads and trgger the delay timer circuit which completes the circuit of the heating coil and hence coil begins to heatup.
  - Auto cutoff of heating: The time for which the heating coil heats is controlable, this delay for circuit to break can be controlled by adjusting the circuit componemts parameters. In our study the average time to start burning a dry pad was about 40sec.

The inncinirator has further advantsges, the dimensions of prototype are so small which makes it easily portable, light and can be used even in remote places with power shortages. It can be also used as a solar powered device, solar charged battery can easily power the incinirator.
